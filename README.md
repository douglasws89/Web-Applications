# README #

This repository contains my Final Project for my Web Application Class. As I didn't have too much time to complete the project, it is still a prototype that is going to be improved upon over the next few months. 


The project uses Web2py framework. This branch contains both, the zip file and the web2py file.
The project is hosted here: 
[https://douglasws89.pythonanywhere.com/Final_Project/default/index](https://douglasws89.pythonanywhere.com/Final_Project/default/index)

To build and run it: 
* install web2py
* build a project locally
* once you have a welcome project running on your local machine, go to the administrative interface.
* under your local administrative interface, on the right side there is a section that says: "Upload and install packed application"
* select the web2py file from this repository. Install and run it.
